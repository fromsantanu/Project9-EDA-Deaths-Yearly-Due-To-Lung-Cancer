## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas, folium, IPython and geopandas package.

## Dataset

The dataset has been generated by another program. However, it is recommended that for real life analysis actual data should be collected and processed properly to get realistic results.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below. However, the output may not be generated on colab. For that you have to download the program and run it locally. Make sure that the packages are all installed.

![Program Output](output.png)

**This program generates a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of lung cancer deaths attributed to different risk factors (smokers, alcoholics, and COPD patients) over a range of years (2018-2023). Here's what can be inferred from the output:**

- **Yearly Comparison:**

  - The x-axis represents the years from 2018 to 2023, allowing for a comparison of lung cancer deaths across these years.

- **Risk Factor Analysis:**

  - The chart distinguishes between three different risk factors: smokers, alcoholics, and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients. Each risk factor is represented by a different color (Red for smokers, Yellow for alcoholics, Grey for COPD patients).
  - This helps in understanding which risk factor contributes more to lung cancer deaths in each year.

- **Visual Clarity:**

  - The grouped bar chart format makes it easy to compare the number of deaths for each risk factor within the same year and across different years.
  - The use of different colors and a legend ensures clarity and helps in distinguishing between the different categories.

- **Trends Over Time:**

  - By examining the height of the bars for each risk factor over the years, one can identify trends such as increases or decreases in lung cancer deaths associated with each risk factor.
  - For instance, if the bars representing smokers show a consistent decrease over the years, it might indicate the effectiveness of anti-smoking campaigns.

- **Public Health Insights:**

  - The chart provides valuable information for public health officials to understand the impact of different risk factors on lung cancer mortality.
  - It can help in identifying which risk factors need more attention and resources for intervention.

- **Comparison Among Risk Factors:**

  - The chart allows for direct comparison between the number of deaths caused by different risk factors in any given year, highlighting which factor is the most significant contributor to lung cancer deaths.

In summary, the output of this program provides a clear and informative visualization of lung cancer deaths attributed to different risk factors over a span of six years, helping to identify trends, make comparisons, and inform public health strategies.
